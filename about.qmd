Hey Everyone! my name is Liam Gilson, and I am a 3rd year Hydrologic Sciences and Policy major at UC Santa Barbara. I grew up in the beautiful Napa Valley in a small town called Angwin. I went to Pacific Union College Elementary school from 1st to 8th grade, St. Helena High school all 4 years, Cuesta College to complete my certificate for transfer, and finally UCSB just this last year. I love sports, travelling and adventure, friends and family, art and food, and many more. I decided to become a Hydrology major because of my passion for California natural history and earth science. I credit my 7th grade teacher, Mr. Crow, for introducing me to environmental sciences. When I get older I want to have a job in hydrology that allows me to serve and better the community in which I live.

### Hydrology

I chose to study Hydrology because of my interest in natural science. In California, water is the new gold and I thought it would be an amazing way to concentrate my study in environmental science. At a young age, I heard stories about water wars between Northern and Southern California. Every year I would drive to my grandmas house in Oregon, and pass over Lake Shasta. It was so painfully low growing up and I think those experiences definitely fired me up about water management. This summer, I will be getting my first hands on experience in Hydrology, when I join the Santa Barbara Flood Control District in a summer internship, and I am very excited!

### Art

Throughout my life, I have always had a fun time making art. My Fathers side of the family has lots of artists, and I remember as a little kid my Aunt Susan would come from Alameda to do arts and crafts with me. In school, I loved the freedom of being able to make art however I wanted. In high school I took two years of Art as my elective credits, where I gained more technical skills in art. I am no professional, but making drawings and paintings, especially abstract ones, has always excited me.

### Fun Adventures

Another one of my favorite things about life is all the fun adventures Ive gone on with my friends and family. When I think of my favorite memories, these are the places that come to mind. For this Interactive Map, I have limited my locations to the state of California.

```{r }
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

# Read in data
locations <- read_csv(file = here("untitled folder", "locations.CSV.csv"))

# Cleaning and filtering
sites <- locations |>
  select(site_name = location, lat, long) |>
  distinct()

# Create custom icon
blue_dot_icon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = here("pics", "liam_dot.png"),
  iconWidth = 30, iconHeight = 30
)

# Initialize map
site_map <- leaflet() |>
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldImagery, group = "ESRI World Imagery") |>
  setView(lng = -119.5, lat = 37.25, zoom = 6) |>

  # Add markers
  addMarkers(
    data = sites,
    icon = blue_dot_icon,
    lng = ~long,
    lat = ~lat,
    popup = ~paste(
      "Location:", site_name, "<br>",
      "Coordinates (lat/long):", lat, ",", long
    )
  ) |>

  # Add reset button
  addResetMapButton()

# Print map
site_map
```

The locations are as follows, Starting at the north-most end, and going south

1.  Lava Beds Nat'l Monument: This is a super cool location that I visited in a class field trip in the 7th grade, unsuprisingly, this trip was put on by Mr. Crow, who i mentioned in the "about me" tab. Lava Beds reminds me of the amazing friends I made in middle school.
2.  Lake Shasta: This is significant to me because every year when driving to my lovely Grandmothers house I would pass over the Pit River Bridge, and see the horrifically low water levels. This planted a seed in my head at a young age for a love for hydrology.
3.  Mt. Rose: This where I first learned how to ski! I went with my friends from my hometown. Since that year I try to ski every winter.
4.  Mendocino : My family has a tradition to spend every Thanksgiving in Mendocino. My family has been doing this since my Father was 3 years old. This is one of the only times of the year I get to connect with my family and it always feels amazing to be back.
5.  Angwin: Home! this is where I grew up and I am forever greatfull to grow up in such a beautiful place.
6.  Salmon Creek: Salmon creek is about a two hour drive from home and I spent lots of time here with friends.
7.  Utica Reservoir: Senior year I went dispersion camping here with the boys. Incredibly beautiful and great memories.
8.  Oracle Park: Home of the San Francisco Giants! coming here always feels like home, and reminds me of the amazing 5 year run we had 2010-2014.
9.  Cambria: this was one of my favorite places to go when living in San Luis Obispo
10. Isla Vista: where I live present day. I am thankful for the sense of community and amazing beach vibes.
