title: "About Me"
---

Baseball has always been one of the most important things for me. I started playing baseball around the age of 8 years old in my backyard. and finally gave it up in my fist year of college, almost 11 years later. Baseball has given me some of my greatest memories and friends, and I cannot thank it enough. It also taught me to believe in myself and it taught me what hard work means. But most importantly it taught me how to be a level headed and in control of my emotions. Baseball has taught me more about life than baseball itself. I would like to thank my coaches Hernan Granados, Andy Isdahl, Paige Dumont, Doc Quirici, and most importantly my Mother and Father.
