Hey Everyone! my name is Liam Gilson, and I am a 3rd year Hydrologic Sciences and Policy major at UC Santa Barbara. I grew up in the beautiful Napa Valley in a small town called Angwin. I went to Pacific Union College Elementary school from 1st to 8th grade, St. Helena High school all 4 years, Cuesta College to complete my certificate for transfer, and finally UCSB just this last year. I love sports, travelling and adventure, friends and family, art and food, and many more. I decided to become a Hydrology major because of my passion for California natural history and earth science. I credit my 7th grade teacher, Mr. Crow, for introducting me to environmental sciences. When I get older I want to have a job in hydrology that allows me to serve and better the community in which I live.

I chose to study Hydrology because of my interest in natural science. In California, water is the new gold and I thought it would be an amazing way to concentrate my study in environmental science. At a young age, I heard stories about water wars between Northern and Southern California. Every year I would drive to my grandmas house in Oregon, and pass over Lake Shasta. It was so painfully low growing up and I think those experiences definitely fired me up about water management. This summer, I will be getting my first hands on experience in Hydrology, when I join the Santa Barbara Flood Control District in a summer internship, and I am very excited!
