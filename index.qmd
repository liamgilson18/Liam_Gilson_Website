Hello Everyone! My name is Liam Gilson, and I am a 3rd year Hydrologic Sciences and Policy major at UCSB. I grew up in the beautiful Napa Valley, in the very small town of Angwin, and graduated from Saint Helena High School. From there, I moved to San Luis Obispo where I attended Cuesta College for 3 years. I love going on adventures, sports, and art.
