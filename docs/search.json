    "text": "Hey Everyone! my name is Liam Gilson, and I am a 3rd year Hydrologic Sciences and Policy major at UC Santa Barbara. I grew up in the beautiful Napa Valley in a small town called Angwin. I went to Pacific Union College Elementary school from 1st to 8th grade, St. Helena High school all 4 years, Cuesta College to complete my certificate for transfer, and finally UCSB just this last year. I love sports, travelling and adventure, friends and family, art and food, and many more. I decided to become a Hydrology major because of my passion for California natural history and earth science. I credit my 7th grade teacher, Mr. Crow, for introducting me to environmental sciences. When I get older I want to have a job in hydrology that allows me to serve and better the community in which I live.\n\n\n\nMe at Pirates Cove, near Avila Beach\n\n\nI chose to study Hydrology because of my interest in natural science. In California, water is the new gold and I thought it would be an amazing way to concentrate my study in environmental science. At a young age, I heard stories about water wars between Northern and Southern California. Every year I would drive to my grandmas house in Oregon, and pass over Lake Shasta. It was so painfully low growing up and I think those experiences definitely fired me up about water management. This summer, I will be getting my first hands on experience in Hydrology, when I join the Santa Barbara Flood Control District in a summer internship, and I am very excited!\n\n\n\nHere is a GIS map where I delineated the watershed basin for Mission Creek in Santa Barbara"

    "text": "Baseball has always been one of the most important things for me. I started playing baseball around the age of 6 years old in my backyard. My earliest memory of baseball is trying to hit homeruns over a small fence in our garden with a wiffle ball. My first year of little league is something I’ll never forget. I was instantly one of the most skilled little kids, and I led my team of 8 and 9 year old’s to win the championship.\nThe next year I was one of only 2 kids to get brought up to the older kids league at the age of 10. Here I met my coach and great friend Jim Gamble. Playing at this higher level skyrocketed my skillset, and pushed me to play with kids bigger and stronger than me.\nI played baseball every single year until I entered college, where I finally gave it up almost 13 years after playing with mom in the back yard.\nAs a shy kid from up in the mountains, Baseball was my way to socialize and meet new friends. Many of the people I played ball with are still some of my closest friends. Baseball was a huge source of confidence in my younger days, and it was the first thing that I ever really excelled at.\nBaseball has given me some of my greatest memories and friends, and I cannot thank it enough. It also taught me to believe in myself and it taught me what hard work means. But most importantly it taught me how to be a level headed and in control of my emotions. Baseball has taught me more about life than baseball itself. I would like to thank my coaches Hernan Granados, Andy Isdahl, Paige Dumont, Doc Quirici, and most importantly my Mother and Father.\n\n\n\nMy first year of little league where I gained my love for baseball (bottom left)My third year of little league where I first played with my best friend Stacy, who is in the background (center) Travel ball around the age of 14 (top left) Me and the boys after a clutch walk off win versus our rivals senior year of High School (top right) My MVP award from my senior year of High school.
