    "text": "Since coming to UCSB I have been able to work on some super cool projects!\nOne of my most interesting projects I have worked on is a grant application for a river restoration project. The project is taking place on Coyote Creek, in Ventura County. Coyote Creek is a tributary of the Ventura river, and proceeds the Lake Casitas Dam. This area is probematic beacuse for two reasons; The Thomas Fire of 2017 and the Lake Casitas Dam. In short, the dam significantly reduces flow rates and sediment connectivity. Meanwhile, the charred Red Mountain pushes incredible amounts of sediment into the river channel. The result is sediment piling up over 10 feet above agreed upon heights, which in turn floods the community on a yearly basis. My team visited in the dry months and the one road in and out of the community was flooded around 4 inches high.\nThis was a very cool project because its a real grant application! we submitted it to the necessary officials and are hoping for an answer back soon.\nNOTE: this application is not perfect, and was NOT the final grant application we submitted. However it is very close.\nYou can preview or download the full proposal below:\n\n&lt;p&gt;This browser does not support PDFs.

    "text": "Baseball has always been one of the most important things for me. I started playing baseball around the age of 6 years old in my backyard. My earliest memory of baseball is trying to hit homeruns over a small fence in our garden with a wiffle ball. My first year of little league is something I’ll never forget. I was instantly one of the most skilled little kids, and I led my team of 8 and 9 year old’s to win the championship.\nThe next year I was one of only 2 kids to get brought up to the older kids league at the age of 10. Here I met my coach and great friend Jim Gamble. Playing at this higher level skyrocketed my skillset, and pushed me to play with kids bigger and stronger than me.\nI played baseball every single year until I entered college, where I finally gave it up almost 13 years after playing with mom in the back yard.\nAs a shy kid from up in the mountains, Baseball was my way to socialize and meet new friends. Many of the people I played ball with are still some of my closest friends. Baseball was a huge source of confidence in my younger days, and it was the first thing that I ever really excelled at.\nBaseball has given me some of my greatest memories and friends, and I cannot thank it enough. It also taught me to believe in myself and it taught me what hard work means. But most importantly it taught me how to be level headed and in control of my emotions. Baseball has taught me more about life than baseball itself. I would like to thank my coaches Hernan Granados, Andy Isdahl, Paige Dumont, Doc Quirici, and most importantly my Mother and Father.\n\n\n\nMy first year of little league where I gained my love for baseball (bottom left) My third year of little league where I first played with my best friend Stacy, who is in the background (center) Travel ball around the age of 14 (top left) Me and the boys after a clutch walk off win versus our rivals senior year of High School (top right) My MVP award from my senior year of High school.

    "text": "Hey everyone! my name is Liam Gilson, and I am a 3rd year Hydrologic Sciences and Policy major at UC Santa Barbara. I grew up in the beautiful Napa Valley in a small town called Angwin. I went to Pacific Union College Elementary school from 1st to 8th grade, St. Helena High school all 4 years, Cuesta College to complete my certificate for transfer, and finally UCSB just past last year. I love sports, travelling and adventure, friends and family, art and food, and many more. I decided to become a Hydrology major because of my passion for California natural history and earth science. I credit my 7th grade teacher, Mr. Crow, for introducing me to environmental sciences. When I get older I want to have a job in Hydrology that allows me to serve and better the community in which I live.\n\n\n\n\nMe at Pirates Cove, near Avila Beach\n\n\n\n\nHydrology\nI chose to study Hydrology because of my interest in natural science. In California, water is the new gold and I thought it would be an amazing way to concentrate my study in environmental science. At a young age, I heard stories about water wars between Northern and Southern California. Every year I would drive to my grandmas house in Oregon, and pass over Lake Shasta. It was so painfully low growing up and I think those experiences definitely fired me up about water management. This summer, I will be getting my first hands on experience in Hydrology, when I join the Santa Barbara Flood Control District in a summer internship, and I am very excited!\n\n\n\n\nHere is a GIS map where I delineated the watershed basin for Mission Creek in Santa Barbara\n\n\n\n\n\nArt\nThroughout my life, I have always had a fun time making art. My Fathers side of the family has lots of artists, and I remember as a little kid my Aunt Susan would come from Alameda to do arts and crafts with me. In school, I loved the freedom of being able to make art however I wanted. In high school I took two years of Art as my elective credits, where I gained more technical skills in art. I am no professional, but making drawings and paintings, especially abstract ones, has always excited me.\n\n\n\n\nMe looking at a painting in an art exhibit (top left) Our house’s table that I designed and painted (top right) A graffiti stencil I created (bottom left) Some photography (bottom middle) and lastly a hand made ink abstract drawing (bottom right)\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Adventures\nAnother one of my favorite things about life is all the fun adventures Ive gone on with my friends and family. When I think of my favorite memories, these are the places that come to mind. For this Interactive Map, I have limited my locations to the state of California.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe locations are as follows, Starting at the north-most end, and going south\n\nLava Beds Nat’l Monument: This is a super cool location that I visited in a class field trip in the 7th grade, unsuprisingly, this trip was put on by Mr. Crow, who i mentioned in the “about me” tab. Lava Beds reminds me of the amazing friends I made in middle school.\nLake Shasta: This is significant to me because every year when driving to my lovely Grandmothers house I would pass over the Pit River Bridge, and see the horrifically low water levels. This planted a seed in my head at a young age for a love for hydrology.\nMt. Rose: This where I first learned how to ski! I went with my friends from my hometown. Since that year I try to ski every winter.\nMendocino : My family has a tradition to spend every Thanksgiving in Mendocino. My family has been doing this since my Father was 3 years old. This is one of the only times of the year I get to connect with my family and it always feels amazing to be back.\nAngwin: Home! this is where I grew up and I am forever greatfull to grow up in such a beautiful place.\nSalmon Creek: Salmon creek is about a two hour drive from home and I spent lots of time here with friends.\nUtica Reservoir: Senior year I went dispersion camping here with the boys. Incredibly beautiful and great memories.\nOracle Park: Home of the San Francisco Giants! coming here always feels like home, and reminds me of the amazing 5 year run we had 2010-2014.\nCambria: this was one of my favorite places to go when living in San Luis Obispo\nIsla Vista: where I live present day. I am thankful for the sense of community and amazing beach vibes."
