    "text": "Baseball has always been one of the most important things for me. I started playing baseball around the age of 8 years old in my backyard. and finally gave it up in my fist year of college, almost 11 years later. Baseball has given me some of my greatest memories and friends, and I cannot thank it enough. It also taught me to believe in myself and it taught me what hard work means. But most importantly it taught me how to be a level headed and in control of my emotions. Baseball has taught me more about life than baseball itself. I would like to thank my coaches Hernan Granados, Andy Isdahl, Paige Dumont, Doc Quirici, and most importantly my Mother and Father.\n\n\n\nMy first year of little league where I gained my love for baseball (bottom left)My third year of little league where I first played with my bestf riend Stacy, who is in the background (center) Travel ball around the age of 14 (top left) Me and the boys after a clutch walk off win versus our rivals senior year of high school (top right) My MVP award from my senior year of Highschool (bottom right)\n\n\n\n\n\ndid this work??"
